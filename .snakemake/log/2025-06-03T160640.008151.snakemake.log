Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule download in file /data/rnaseq_pipe/Snakefile, line 13:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/sra/SRR2584863.sra
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
